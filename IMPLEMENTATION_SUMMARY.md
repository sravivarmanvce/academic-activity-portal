# Document Management System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Database Schema Integration
‚úÖ **Advanced Document Model**: Updated the application to use your sophisticated PostgreSQL schema with:
- Document versioning and history tracking
- Proper foreign key relationships (departments, academic_years, events)
- Rejection/re-upload workflow with reasons
- PostgreSQL functions for document management

### 2. Backend Updates
‚úÖ **Models**: Updated `backend/app/models/documents.py` to match your advanced schema
‚úÖ **Services**: Completely rewritten `backend/app/services/document_service.py` with:
- Version management for re-uploads
- Automatic document type mapping (report ‚Üî complete_report, zip ‚Üî supporting_documents)
- Full approval/rejection workflow

‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: Updated `backend/app/api/endpoints/documents.py` with:
- Enhanced upload handling with file size and MIME type tracking
- Proper error handling and user role validation
- Compatibility layer for frontend

### 3. Frontend Alignment
‚úÖ **Document Management Component**: Updated `frontend/src/components/DocumentManagement.jsx` with:
- Role-based UI (HoD upload, Principal approve/reject)
- Re-upload functionality for rejected documents
- Status badges and rejection reason display
- Proper action buttons based on user role and document status

### 4. Database Migration Support
‚úÖ **Migration Script**: Created `backend/database_migration.sql` to:
- Add required default data (departments, academic_years, users)
- Create compatibility views
- Set up proper foreign key relationships

‚úÖ **Setup Script**: Created `backend/database_setup.py` for easy database setup

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# 1. Run your original table creation scripts first
psql -d your_database -f your_first_script.sql
psql -d your_database -f your_second_script.sql

# 2. Then run the migration script
psql -d your_database -f backend/database_migration.sql

# 3. OR use the Python setup script (after updating credentials)
python backend/database_setup.py
```

### 2. Test the System
1. **Upload Documents** (HoD role):
   - Select an event
   - Upload both event report (PDF, DOC, or DOCX) and ZIP file
   - Documents should appear with "pending" status

2. **Approval Workflow** (Principal role):
   - View uploaded documents
   - Approve or reject with reasons
   - Rejected documents should show rejection reason

3. **Re-upload** (HoD role):
   - For rejected documents, click re-upload button
   - Upload new versions (supports PDF, DOC, DOCX for reports)
   - Old versions are preserved but marked as not latest

### 3. Configuration Updates
Update your database connection settings in:
- `backend/app/config.py` or your environment variables
- `backend/database_setup.py` (if using the setup script)

## üîß Technical Features Now Available

### Advanced Document Management
- **Versioning**: Every re-upload creates a new version while preserving history
- **Workflow**: Proper approval/rejection workflow with reasons
- **Constraints**: Database ensures only one report and one ZIP per event (latest versions)
- **History**: Full document history available via PostgreSQL functions

### Role-Based Access Control
- **HoD**: Can upload and re-upload documents
- **Principal**: Can approve/reject documents
- **Admin**: Full access to all functions

### Data Integrity
- **Foreign Keys**: Proper relationships with events, departments, academic years
- **Constraints**: Database-level validation of document types and statuses
- **Unique Indexes**: Prevents duplicate documents per event type

## üé® Frontend Features

### User Interface
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators for pending/approved/rejected
- **Action Buttons**: Role-based buttons (approve, reject, re-upload, download)
- **Rejection Reasons**: Display rejection reasons to users
- **File Type Support**: Event reports support PDF, DOC, and DOCX formats
- **File Type Icons**: Visual differentiation between event reports and ZIP files

### Workflow Support
- **Re-upload Modal**: Pre-populated with event when re-uploading rejected documents
- **File Format Validation**: Backend validates PDF, DOC, DOCX for reports and ZIP for archives
- **Filtering**: Filter by event and search by filename
- **Information Banner**: Clear instructions for HoD and Principal roles

## üìä Database Schema Benefits

Your sophisticated database schema provides:
1. **Full Audit Trail**: Track all document versions and changes
2. **Advanced Queries**: Use your PostgreSQL functions for complex operations
3. **Scalability**: Proper indexing and constraints for performance
4. **Flexibility**: Support for future features like document categories, bulk operations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Compatibility**: The application maintains backward compatibility while using the advanced schema
2. **Migration**: Existing data will work with the new system after running migration
3. **Performance**: Indexes are created for optimal query performance
4. **Security**: Role-based access control enforced at both API and database levels

Your document management system is now ready for production use with advanced features while maintaining the simple workflow you requested! üöÄ
