# Database Schema Alignment Options

## Current Situation
- Your database schema uses a complex `documents` table with versioning features
- Your application code expects a simple `event_documents` table
- There's a mismatch that needs to be resolved

## Option 1: Adapt Application to Use Advanced Schema (Recommended)

### Benefits:
- ✅ Leverages your sophisticated database design
- ✅ Full document versioning and history
- ✅ PostgreSQL functions for workflow management
- ✅ Better data integrity and constraints

### Required Changes:
1. Update SQLAlchemy models to match `documents` table
2. Update API endpoints to use the advanced schema
3. Modify frontend to handle versioning features
4. Add migration script to populate required fields

## Option 2: Simplified Schema for Current Application

### Benefits:
- ✅ Minimal code changes required
- ✅ Quick to implement
- ✅ Matches current application logic

### Required Changes:
1. Create simple `event_documents` table
2. Keep current application code mostly unchanged

## Recommendation: Option 1

Your database schema is well-designed and provides much more functionality. Let's adapt the application to use it properly.
